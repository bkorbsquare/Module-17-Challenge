# Module-17-Challenge

## Description

- This gist displays a Regex Tutorial.
- I wanted to write a tutorial about Regex, and break down an example I found.
- I wrote code snippets and descriptions inside of a markdown framework. I used an emoji picker to add flair and personify my writing. 
- Given more time I would go over more/more complex Regex. I would also enjoy writing activities where I pseudo-code parameters and students generate Regex's that fulfill the specifications.
